# 🧪 Variant Analysis with Evo2 – Modal + Next.js 

A full-stack bioinformatics project for **gene variant effect prediction**, powered by the **Evo2 large language model** from Arc Institute. This project features:

* A **Next.js (React)** frontend
* A **FastAPI backend** deployed with **Modal** (H100 GPU)
* Deep analysis and classification of genetic variants (e.g. BRCA1)

---

## 🔬 Overview

This application fetches gene sequences (e.g. from UCSC), runs inference on genetic variants using Evo2 (LLM for genomics), and provides visualizations and classification:

*  Variant classification as Likely Pathogenic or Benign
*  Interactive analysis and scoring
*  BRCA1 demo plot and AUROC calculation
*  HuggingFace caching for model reuse

##  Deployment

###  Backend (Modal)

> Deployed on Modal with GPU (H100) using FastAPI endpoints

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install modal
   ```

2. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   modal token new
   ```

3. Deploy:

   ```bash
   modal deploy main.py
   ```

You will receive a FastAPI endpoint like:

```bash
POST https://variant-analysis-evo2--analyze-single-variant.modal.run/
```

---

##  Example Output

* Delta scores for BRCA1 SNVs
* AUROC of Evo2 on known BRCA1 dataset
* Variant class prediction (LOF vs FUNC/INT)
* Visualization with seaborn + matplotlib

---

##  Requirements (Backend)

```txt
fastapi[standard]
numpy<2.0
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
openpyxl
biopython
```
